I'm a clinical academic with a split role in neurophysiology and computational neuroscience. My research focuses on the
development of computational models to better understand the nervous system, particularly in relation to muscle weakness
and neuromuscular disorders.

I work at the intersection of clinical practice and computational modeling, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical
neuroscience and [practical applications in patient care](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mus.27720).
My goal is to leverage computational tools to enhance our
understanding of neuromuscular function and dysfunction, ultimately improving diagnosis and treatment strategies.

I am also involved in teaching and mentoring students in both clinical and computational neuroscience, and supervise
student projects.

I'm interested in developing new diagnostic tools for complex neuromuscular disorders, and
in [using computational models
to simulate and predict the behavior of neural systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2021.12.022). My work often
involves collaboration with other researchers in
neuroscience, engineering, and clinical medicine.

My previous work has looked at the neurophysiological reasons why we lose strength as we grow
older ([sarcopenia](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2020.104268)).
Previously thought of as a muscle-first disease, I showed [significant changes in the cortico/reticulospinal tract
balance using transcranial magnetic stimulation](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnagi.2021.00000/full),
and developed new ways of assessing the ageing motor unit.

I've also developed an interest in [natural language processing](https://doi.org/10.1136/pmj-2022-142080), large
language models and their potential applications in healthcare, particularly in
improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. I've shown
how [ChatGPT can pass the MRCP written examinations](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-080558),
and yet make fundamental, catastrophic errors, and
discussed [ethics and biases of AI in healthcare](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjinnov-2019-000376)
