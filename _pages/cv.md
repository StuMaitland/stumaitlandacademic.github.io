## Aug 22-Present
**Academic Clinical Fellow in Neurophysiology**  
_Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust/ Newcastle University_

## Feb 22-Aug 22
**Internal Medical Trainee**  
_Northumbria Healthcare_

## Sept 18-Feb 22
**Clinical Doctoral Fellow**  
_Newcastle University_  
NIHR funded clinical PhD research post in neurophysiology, examining novel neurophysiological investigations, including using Electromyography (EMG) as a biomarker of sarcopenia.

## Aug 16- July 18
**Academic Foundation Doctor**  
_Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust_  
Worked on software for a new medical device to diagnose neuromuscular conditions. Discussed requirements with clinicians, and iterated design according to ’lean startup’ methodologies. Released code as open-source for future researchers to use.

Projects
======

## Experimental Neurophysiology
The overarching theme of my research has been in using novel neurophysiological methods to explore neurological disease. This includes Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Neuromuscular Ultrasound and statistical Motor Unit measures including Motor Unit Number Estimation.

## Micro-EMG
I developed a signal processing pipeline to localise complex electrical signals in space around a needle multielectrode. This forms the basis of a medical device (patent #US20180289277A1) currently undergoing assessment by MHRA for improved diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases including ALS & Myasthenia Gravis.

## ExplainThisPaper
Built a website in Python (Django) for the discovery and simplification of advanced medical journal articles. Used by thousands of budding medical researchers, and trusted by scientists including at UCL, Google Health, MHRA. Achieved grant support from Great Ormond Street Hospital & Newcastle University.
